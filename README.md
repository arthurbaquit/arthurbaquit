**`Passionate programmer (Developer)`**
</br>

Since high school, I've been passionate about solving real-life problems with code. As a developer, I'm always eager to learn new tools and apply them in innovative ways. Currently, I'm working as a developer, and I challenge myself to learn something new or different each week to further develop my skills. Check out my GitHub profile to see some of my latest projects.

- At **SuaQuadra**, a real estate platform that connects entrepreneurs with potential business locations, I mainly used **Golang** and **React/TypeScript**.
- At **Clubbi**, a platform that connects small merchants with major retail chains (known as "atacarejos" in Portuguese), I mainly used **typed Python** and **React/TypeScript**.
- At **Osaka University**, I worked in a robotics lab that had partnerships with companies such as **Toyota**. Here, I mainly used **Python**, **C++**, and **ROS**.

  <summary>üë®üèª‚Äçüéì Studying Trajectory</summary>
  
  During high school, I participated in programming science Olympiads, where I won several medals programming in **C/C++**. After joining a Brazilian university, I gained experience in various fields, from microprocessors like **Arduino** applied in IoT to **machine learning**. During that time, I also had the opportunity to learn multiple programming languages such as **R**, **Mathematica**, **Python**, and **Java**.  
  After careful consideration, I decided to pursue my Bachelor's degree in **System Science** at **Osaka University** in Japan. There, I worked in a lab that had partnerships with companies such as **Toyota**, where I gained hands-on experience in robotics using **C++**, **ROS**, and **Python**.

In the past few years, I have had the opportunity to move away from the research world and join the dynamic world of startups, where I started developing web applications and working with web development. Today, I spend my time as a developer, continuously learning through online resources and completing various **Udemy courses** to expand my knowledge and skillset.
